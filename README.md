# Work description 
This is a KPMG Virtual internship program task on Data analytics, where I was analyzing sales & marketing analysis for the client through the provided data. So the client wanted a list of high-priority customers that the marketing team could target. So I conducted a few analyses & gathered insights.
## Insights:-
1. 𝐏𝐮𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐛𝐲 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫:- Data shows, on average females have more purchases compared to males.
2. 𝐈𝐧𝐝𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐲 𝐬𝐞𝐠𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:- The top 3 industry sectors that bring the most profits are; Manufacturing, Financial Services, and Health. Financial services and Manufacturing brings almost 2M in profit.
3. 𝐀𝐠𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐠𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:- Age is the most important factor for bike purchases, most profits come from the age segment of 41-50, and fewer profits come from the age segment of 22-30.
4. 𝐑𝐞𝐠𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬:- Region plays an important role in sales & customer behavior, most of our customers are from NSW state. So customers in this state should be our priority.
5. 𝐁𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐟𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞:- People mostly preferred the Solex brand.

So, the marketing team should target this of the customers for the growth of the company.
